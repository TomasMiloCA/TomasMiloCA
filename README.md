- 👋 Hi, I’m Tomas Milo, a PhD candidate at McGill University. Prior to beggining my doctoral studies, I was a professional accountant (CPA) in Toronto.
- 👀 I’m interested in democratizing financial information. I use Python and Machine Learning to create tools that help make sense of accounting data.
- 🌱 I’m currently researching how analysts and stakeholders use XBRL. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on topics related to accounting and finance, as well as programming in general.

My goal is to facilitate research (and analysis of data in general) - please feel free to use the packages I provide here for your personal and / or professional needs.
